# ðŸš— Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on building a **real-time object detection system** for autonomous vehicles. The model detects and classifies road entities such as **pedestrians, cars, traffic lights,** and **license plates** in real-time, enhancing autonomous navigation and safety.

It leverages **transfer learning** and **data augmentation** tools to create a robust pipeline capable of adapting to real-world environments, including various lighting and weather conditions.
